        <section className="mb-6">
          <p>
            Welcome to our platform, a powerful tool designed to assist beginner
            investors in tracking and managing their investments. This project
            is the brainchild of Vitalii Khomenko, a {age}-year-old investment
            enthusiast who was born on April 5, 2008. Despite his young age,
            Vitalii has shown a remarkable aptitude for investments, creating a
            comprehensive Google Sheets table to track his progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing the potential to make this process even more efficient,
            Dmytro Turskyi, the husband of Vitalii&apos;s sister, stepped in to
            bring Vitalii&apos;s vision to life. As a developer, Dmytro built
            this project to replicate and expand upon the functionalities of
            Vitalii&apos;s Google Sheets table. The web version of this project
            includes authentication features, allowing anyone to create an
            account and manage their investments, whether they are purchased or
            not.
          </p>
          <p>
            This platform is not just a tool but a testament to the
            collaborative effort between Vitalii, who provided the business
            ideas and the necessary investment knowledge, and Dmytro, who
            implemented these ideas into a functional and user-friendly
            application. If a high school student can create and utilize such a
            powerful tool, so can any beginner investor.
